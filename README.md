# Probability Distribution
The project covers basics of different probability distributions commonly used in Data Science domian. Probability distributions are a fundamental concept in statistics. They are used both on a theoretical level and a practical level. Some practical uses of probability distributions are:

<ol>
<li>To calculate confidence intervals for parameters and to calculate critical regions for hypothesis tests.</li>
<li>For univariate data, it is often useful to determine a reasonable distributional model for the data.</li>
<li>Statistical intervals and hypothesis tests are often based on specific distributional assumptions. Before computing an interval or test based on a distributional assumption, we need to verify that the assumption is justified for the given data set. In this case, the distribution does not need to be the best-fitting distribution for the data, but an adequate enough model so that the statistical technique yields valid conclusions.</li>
<li>Simulation studies with random numbers generated from using a specific probability distribution are often needed.</li>
